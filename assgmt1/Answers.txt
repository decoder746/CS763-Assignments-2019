I have used the hueristic that I choose the word with the longest pronounciation.(Used
this because in Q3.3 it was given to choose the longest pronounciation).
Also the setup and everything is good but the lookups are very slow and don't know the reason for that.

This won't work when the context of the prefix and suffix is quite different than in the original words from which the pronounciations were choosen.
This can be improved by assigning higher weights to the breakup of word which are more reasonable like in the word "IMPROVEMENT"  it should be broken like "IMPROVE" + "MENT" rather than "IMP" + "ROVEMENT".
